Local Repo to Text Converter
======

`abinthomasonline` developed a great project `https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt` to convert a Github 
repository into a text file. This project is useful for those who want to read the content of a repository offline.

Features follow the original project. 

The project is FULLY generated by `claude3.5-sonnet`. Thanks to the LLM, the project was generated in a half hour.

## Usage

### Server side

```bash
npm install
```

Run the project, the ROOT_PATH is the path to your local code folder like `/home/latyas/workspace`
```bash
npm -- --path ROOT_PATH --port 8000 
```

### UI
Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

In `Subfolder Path` input the path to your local code folder like `repo2txt` which full path
is `/home/latyas/workspace/repo2txt`, and the rest of process is the same as the original project.
